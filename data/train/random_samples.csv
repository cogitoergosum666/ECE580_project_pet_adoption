Candy - Female; Light brown; Blue eyes Muffin - Male; Mixed black & brown; Black eyes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Due to the overwhelming response from my last listing (I got close to emails/ sms/ calls), I am sorry but I need to lay down some ground rules. Thank you VERY VERY MUCH in advance for reading this listing and forwarding it to your friends and family. Apologies in advance if the Terms and Conditions set out below are a little ""harsh"", but I have gotten too many calls/ responses from very rude people, calls from people who do not even know that it is NOT OK to call people at 2am, etc. Also, our intentions are very simple: WE JUST WANT TO FIND GOOD HOMES FOR THE PUPPIES. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TERMS AND CONDITIONS:- (1) Please DO NOT ask me what breed these are, they are stray puppies. If you want a pedigree Siberian Husky or Rottweiler, please visit your neighbourhood pet shop. (2) These are large breed dogs, they will grow into a standard size dog. They are not toy dogs, hence not suitable for those who live in an apartment/ condominium. (3) Please DO NOT delete my all these information and just forward the photos. I get too many people asking me for information which I have already given in the first place. (4) This listing is dated 13-May-. This is to manage your expectations on whether the puppy you fell in love with is still available. (5) We reside in Seri Kembangan, KL, near the Astro office (there is someone at home 95% of the time). Please only contact us if you are willing to come to our house to pick the puppies up. It will also mean that we get a chance to meet the new ""owners"" to see whether they are suitable for the puppies. We want to find good homes for the puppies and ensure that they do not get kicked out into the streets once they are grown and lose their cuteness. (6) Please do not adopt the puppies from us and resale them. We have lots of contacts. If you are trying to sell the puppies, we will know & we will catch you. (7) If you and your family members are interested to adopt, please get agreement from all members before contacting us. We do not want them to get kicked out into the streets because of one of your family member dislike them. Those who are interested and agreeable to the above 7 points, please read on:- (8) The puppies are free, but as a gesture of sincerity, we hope you can donate RM50 to either SPCA or PAWS. You can pass us the money when you pick up the puppy. We will donate on your behalf and mail you the receipt in your name. If for any reason you cannot afford this token donation, please let us know the reason why, we are very reasonable people. (9) You will need to let us know some basic information about yourself as follows (do include this info in your email):- - Name - Where you live and type of house - Who you live with - Some history on whether you have owned any dogs before (10) No reservations please. First come first served. (11) If your friend/ cousin/ girlfriend/ uncle/ husband/ aunt etc is the one interested to adopt, please ask him/ her to contact us directly. It is easier for all this way. (12) All who are interested, please send an email to . If you need clarifications, please call  or . Please leave me an SMS if you can't get me.",0ac2e7d16,20.0,1

She was very skinny and they knew they had to help her. Unfortunately they're very allergic to cats so i'm sweet pea's foster mum now. While i was driving to my friends' place to pick up sweet pea i saw a tiny furry lump in the middle of the LDP highway. It was Oliver! I dashed out and grabbed him then picked up sweet pea and off we went to the vet! What a miserable trio we were. Both kittens were weak, dehydrated, and sickened by awful intestinal infections. Poor sweet pea had scratches on her face probably from a run-in with an adult cat. Little oliver was bleeding from his mouth and bled all over my skirt. The good news is they're both well on the road to complete recovery thanks to my regular vets. Sweet pea is about 3 months old with a white coat and pretty eyes. Oliver is a growing 6 week old Marmalade male with a tiny midget tail. They're playful rascals who like to wrestle with each other and enjoy a nice warm cuddle with people. These two needs lots of attention and responsible, caring families to care for them. They need PERMANENT homes. Vaccinations and neutering/spaying are compulsory for adoption. These two have had enough horrible experiences with the outside world. They are to be kept strictly indoors. Will post photos as soon as they're done with their courses of antibiotics.

In the midst of dying of hunger, luckily an angel came. He is the shop owner there, and he decided we should live, found all of us a temporarily foster home to take care of us.

Kitten must be kept indoors to avoid accidents. 2. Kitten must follow up with the vaccinations. 3. Kitten must be spayed when reaches 6 months old. Rescuer Note: Kitten is not ready to be neutered yet until he/she is 6 months old. It is very important to neuter him/her when he/she is ready, as this will prevent him/her from getting lost. The male cat will wander off your home to find any female cat on heat, while the female cat will wander off when on heat, and will get pregnant. Risk of losing your cat is very high if you don't neuter them. And also your cat may risk injury due to fighting or your furniture will risk damage as well, as un-neutered cat is more aggressive.",cd2451ab4,7.0,3
